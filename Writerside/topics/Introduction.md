# Introduction

<warning>This is, and always will be a draft of my experience with Linux</warning>

<warning>If you have (advanced) experience with Linux, this might not be for you</warning>

So this has been a long time coming. As a GNU/Linux user/ fan, I never knew how I could contribute or help new 
people get into GNU/Linux. Let's be clear, a lot of the information here you can find in other tutorials and places 
about GNU/Linux. Before you start diving into my brain fart here, please know:

- I will no longer write GNU/Linux but will call it linux. [Read all about naming here](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#why)
- All these findings/opinions are my own. They might be controversial or different from what you will find in other 
  communities
- I want to write this as my point of view. For more in depth information, I will try and find reliable 
  sources and link to those.
- I will reminisce, talk about my journey, etc. This isn't your typical tutorial
- This is a **living** document, I will edit/rephrase/add or remove parts.
