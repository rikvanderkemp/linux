# Linux can be frustrating

Yes, there I said it. Linux can and will be frustrating when you first start to look into it. Consider what I wrote
earlier. Linux in its core (the kernel) has supports for tons of components, but not all of them. All the support,
or at least most of the support hangs in the balance of all those contributors making sure things 'just work.'

Say that you start as an audio card manufacturer, would you spend time and money on writing support for Linux if
you know Windows and macOS are far more popular and in use at the moment? The answer in most cases is no. It's a
shame but also the cold hard truth.

And yes, thankfully, the support for linux is increasing each year. Popularity is rising, thank you Steamdeck. But
still, the user experience you will get is solely based on those thousands of contributors, who, mind you, don't have
all the components to work with.

Consider what Linus Torvalds wrote when he brought out the first version of Linux:

Understand that contributors, only have hardware they actually own!

And it's crucial that you understand this! Support is mostly given through peoples' time and effort for stuff
they own, know, etc.

Your complete experience with Linux as a desktop is in the hands of those who spent their time on the system as a
whole.

This includes:

- Driver support
- Desktop environments
- Boot/Startup systems
- Initialization processes
- etc etc

And with a massive ton of hardware vendors and software out there, it is almost an impossible task to give you
100% perfection.

Next to all these contributors there are also commercial companies that are working hard on Linux, to name a few:

- [Intel](https://intel.com)
- [Oracle](https://oracle.com)
- [IBM](https://ibm.com)
- [Redhat](https://redhat.com)
- [Suse](https://www.suse.com)
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)

So nobody is alone, and without these companies (and many more) it would've been an impossible task.
