# So why choose Linux?

This is a question I cannot answer for you! For me, using Linux means I can use my laptop or desktop PC exactly how
I want it. For me personally, it is definitely not **just about open source**. I see this mentioned so many times,
but it just isn't the main reason for me. I could do my work just fine on macOS or even on Windows. But being a
software engineer, I feel I'm always fighting an uphill battle. Running certain software designed for Linux
(such as server software, or other related applications) can be a drag. But in time it will work and it'll probably
function just fine.

But in the end, it's about convenience and being able to use my computer how I want. I grew up with computers thanks
to my dad, I started on the ZX Spectrum. I'm not scared about a terminal as I lived in DOS for a while, and
when the internet broke through, I was a full-blown Windows user with sidesteps to Apple! So I've seen a lot and
I've used many
Operating Systems. With that, I developed a way of working. I came to appreciate certain interface designs and came to
dislike others. I'm also not a typical geek. My keyboard layout is just qwerty, don't have a fancy diy keyboard and
still use the mouse, I could never go without how hard I tried.

I got stuck in a certain period, I think, and if my computers behave differently, or I can't quickly fix things, I get
annoyed. But Windows and macOS both were and are changing, renewing, etc. And those changes are great for
new users and not so great if you're stuck in your own ways. Instead of offering more customization, macOS saw fewer,
thinning-down applications increasingly to match their tablet inspired interfaces. Windows, I don't know what they
tried, some parts of Windows are still stuck in the past, while other parts increasingly got more confusing. Not
only that, but the amount of tracking and advertisements are getting out of hand.

And I suppose that's what bothers me. Microsoft is implementing so many tracking and adverts. macOS dumbing down on
everything along with so many paid applications for such simple tasks. But I'll put aside my grievances
about these things for now. This is not the place.

In the end, it's all about the question; What do you want out of an operating system?
