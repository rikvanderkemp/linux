# Choosing your hardware

<warning>As you will read a lot on the web, the safest way to understand Linux and without loosing data is 
by using a Virtual Machine. I do recommend this as well. But I don't want this to be a Virtual Machine 
tutorial.</warning>

<warning>I'm not going to focus on gaming, while supported on Linux, this is a whole different subject and 
worthy of its own manual</warning>

In the previous ramblings I've discussed why Linux is different from other operating systems, this is a short TL;DR

- A computer is made of thousands of components;
- Most support for those components is created and maintained by contributors, not all vendors support Linux 
  out-of-box;
- A lot of contributors do this in their spare time;
- Your first experience with Linux can be frustrating;

Now that you know, I can give you some tips to get started quickly without to many issues.

## Laptops

Some safe criteria to choose the right laptop;

- Find a laptop from a well-known brand. Dell/HP or Lenovo, for instance.
- Choose an older machine over the latest one. Remember those contributors and vendor support?
- See if you can find a parts list for the main components; Graphics card, Wi-Fi card, CPU

You are looking for great support.

Usually a quick Google will give you answers if a specific piece of hardware is 
supported.
If this is going to be your first laptop for Linux, a nice older Lenovo t480 might do just fine.

Here's a short list of what you might look for:

<table>
<tr>
<th>CPU</th>
<td>Intel or AMD. Find something in the mid-range of these</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Wi-Fi / Bluetooth</th>
<td>Intel AX200 (or Pro)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Graphics</th>
<td>Either onboard from AMD or Intel, or AMD / NVIDIA <a href="#graphics">*</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

Not very surprising, is it?
Know that your CPU will most always just work.
You might run into Wi-Fi issues, so 
instead of making it difficult for yourself, get something that is supported or replace before you begin.
Most laptops from known vendors allow you to replace the Wi-Fi adapter.

### A word on graphics {id="graphics"}

Yes, NVIDIA is actually OK, it is, however, a very controversial take of mine.
And it is very nuanced.
I have had my 
share of issues with NVIDIA in the past.
And there are many issues with many pieces of (Desktop managers or tiling window managers) software (usually just plain 
unsupported).
But I think if you stick to the proprietary drivers of NVIDIA, you'll be fine, actually.
And (should be boring by now), if you stick with a little bit older hardware, your success rate goes up.
