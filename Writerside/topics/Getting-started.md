# Getting started

## Choosing your hardware

<warning>As you will read a lot on the web, the most safe way to understand Linux and without loosing data is 
by using a Virtual Machine. I do recommend this as well. But I don't want this to be a Virtual Machine 
tutorial.</warning>

<warning>I'm not going to focus on gaming, while supported on Linux, this is a whole different subject and 
worthy of its own manual</warning>

In the previous ramblings I've discussed why Linux is different from other operating systems, this is a short TL;DR

- A computer is made of thousands of components;
- Most support for those components is created and maintained by contributors, not all vendors support Linux 
  out-of-box;
- A lot of contributors do this in their spare time;
- Your first experience with Linux can be frustrating;

Now that you know, I can give you some tips to get started quickly without to many issues.

### Laptops

Some safe criteria to choose the right laptop;

- Find a laptop from a well-known brand. Dell/HP or Lenovo, for instance.
- Choose an older machine over the latest one. Remember those contributors and vendor support?
- See if you can find a parts list for the main components; Graphics card, Wi-Fi card, CPU

You are looking for great support.

Usually a quick Google will give you answers if a specific piece of hardware is 
supported.
If this is going to be your first laptop for Linux, a nice older Lenovo t480 might do just fine.

Here's a short list of what you might look for:

<table>
<tr>
<th>CPU</th>
<td>Intel or AMD. Find something in the mid-range of these</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Wi-Fi</th>
<td>Intel AX200 (or Pro)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Graphics</th>
<td>Either onboard from AMD or Intel, or AMD / NVIDIA <a href="#graphics">*</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
